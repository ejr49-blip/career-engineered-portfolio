## Project Overview
This project is a career-engineered portfolio designed to position me as a **Computer Systems Analyst / Automation-Focused Software Engineer**. The site emphasizes systems thinking, automation mindset, and verifiable technical proof through GitHub repositories.

The goal is clarity: a recruiter should understand my role, value, and proof within **5 seconds** of landing on the site.

## Call to Action
**Primary CTA:**  
👉 *View My GitHub Contributions*

This aligns with recruiter behavior and reduces friction by sending visitors directly to technical proof.

## Orchestration Log (AI Collaboration)
During development, the AI initially recommended using a React-based framework. I challenged this decision due to time constraints and unnecessary complexity for a proof-of-work portfolio. We pivoted to a lightweight HTML/CSS approach, enabling same-day deployment while better reflecting a systems-oriented engineering mindset.
